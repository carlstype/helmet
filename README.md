# Helmet

Helmet is a neo-grotesque display typeface, inspired by Swiss classics like Helvetica and Univers. The typeface plays with vertical and horizontal proportions to create a unique look, which suits both large and small text. Licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Helmet is free both for personal and commercial use.
